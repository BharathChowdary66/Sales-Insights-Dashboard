##### **Sales Trend by Month**

##### 

##### The monthly sales trend shows a clear seasonal pattern. Sales peak in December and remain strong in November and September, indicating high purchasing activity around year-end periods and possibly seasonal promotions. After August, sales start to decline steadily. From May to February, sales continue to drop month-by-month, reaching the lowest point in February.

##### 

##### This downward pattern suggests that customer demand is significantly influenced by seasonal factors, with major sales happening in the last quarter of the year, followed by a slowdown during the first quarter.

##### 

##### **Sales Count by Region**

##### 

##### The Graph shows that the Central region dominates with the highest number of sales transactions, followed by the South and North regions. These three regions collectively contribute a major proportion of total sales volume, indicating they are strong and active markets.

##### 

##### The middle tier regions like EMEA, Africa, and Oceania show moderate sales activity, suggesting potential areas for strategic growth with improved marketing or operational support.

##### 

##### Regions such as Southeast Asia, West, East, and North Asia show the lowest sales counts, indicating limited engagement or smaller market presence. These regions could be targeted with tailored campaigns to improve performance.

##### 

##### **Sales by Country**

##### 

##### The United States stands out as the top contributor, generating significantly higher revenue than any other country, indicating a dominant market share and strong customer base. Australia follows as the second-highest revenue-generating country, suggesting it is also a key market for the business.

##### 

##### Countries such as France, China, Germany, and Mexico show steady sales performance and represent important mid-tier markets with consistent revenue streams.

##### 

##### However, many other countries including Nicaragua, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Turkey, Japan, South Africa, and Austria contribute much smaller portions to overall sales. These countries reflect low market penetration or limited sales activity, highlighting potential regions for expansion strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.





##### **Sales by Product Category**

##### 

##### Among the three product categories, Technology leads with the highest share of total sales, contributing 37.53%. This indicates a strong customer preference for technology-related products and reflects a major revenue driver for the business.

##### 

##### Furniture follows closely with 32.52% of overall sales, showing it is also a competitive and profitable category with solid market demand.

##### 

##### Office Supplies, although still significant at 29.96%, generate the lowest sales among the categories. This suggests they may be lower-value products or have less frequent purchasing patterns compared to Technology and Furniture items.

##### 

##### The distribution shows that all three categories play an important role in total revenue, but strategic focus on Technology offerings could continue to boost overall business growth.
